Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.",Martha's Vineyard,96,235,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Heitz
